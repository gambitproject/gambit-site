    "We get different estimates $\\hat{\\lambda}$ for the different methods.  This is of course completely OK; they are different estimation procedures so we don't expect to get the same answer.  But there are some patterns: in three of the four cases, the payoff method estimates a smaller $\\hat{\\lambda}$ than the fixed-point method, that is, it estimates less precise behaviour.  In the last case, where the fixed-point method claims play is close to Nash, the payoff method claims it is closest to uniform randomisation.\n",

Suppose we knew that players were actually playing a QRE with a given value of $\\lambda$, which we set to $1.5$ for our purposes here, as being roughly in the range observed over most of the Ochs experiment.  Using Gambit we can compute the corresponding mixed strategy profile."

    "Now, we can add to this correspondence plot information about our simulated data and fits.  For each simulated observation, we plot the simulated strategy frequencies.  We then plot from that point a red line, which links the observed frequencies to the fitted point on the QRE correspondence using the payoff method, and a blue line, which links the observed frequencies to the fitted point using the fixed-point method.  It becomes clear that the fixed-point method (blue) lines generally link up to points farther along the correspondence, i.e. ones with higher $\\lambda$."

    "In the view of this researcher, the real strength of the logit model is in using it to estimate other parameters of interest.  The logit model has some attractive foundations in terms of information theory which make it ideal for this task (in addition to being computationally quite tractable).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is precisely in these applications where the payoff-based estimation approach is most attractive.  The fixed-point method becomes progressively more computationally infeasible as the game gets larger, or as the number of parameters to be considered grows.  The payoff approach on the other hand scales much more attractively.  What we really want to know, then, is not so much whether $\\hat\\lambda$ is biased, but whether estimates of *other* parameters of interest are systematically biased as well.\n",
