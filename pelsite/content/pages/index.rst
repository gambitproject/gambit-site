**Gambit** is an open-source collection of tools for doing computation in game theory. With Gambit, you can build, analyze, and explore game models.

Use `Gambit's graphical interface <gambit15/gui.html>`_ to get
intuition about simple games, or the
`command-line tools <gambit15/tools.html>`_ and
`Python scripting API <gambit15/pyapi.html>`_ to support
your world-class research and practical applications.

Gambit is **fully cross-platform**: Get it for Microsoft Windows, Mac
OS X, or Linux.


Getting started
###############

Gambit 15
---------

`Gambit 15 <gambit15/index.html>`_ is the current stable version.

or `read the documentation online <gambit15/index.html>`__.


Gambit 16
---------

`Gambit 16 <gambit16/index.html>`_ is the current research/development
version.  This is targeted at researchers who want the latest
features, or who are developing methods for the computational analysis
of games.
`Download the latest release (16.0.0)
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/gambit/files/gambit16/16.0.0>`_
or `read the documentation online <gambit16/16.0.0/index.html>`__.

Game Theory Explorer
--------------------

For an even faster start, try the online
`Game Theory Explorer <http://www.gametheoryexplorer.org>`_ tool,
which allows you to build and solve games interactively in your web browser.
`Launch it in your browser <http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/gte>`_ or
`read the GTE documentation <http://www.gametheoryexplorer.org>`_.

Previous versions
-----------------

Previous versions of Gambit are made available to facilitate
reproducing calculations done with those versions.  Only very limited
support of these versions is available.
